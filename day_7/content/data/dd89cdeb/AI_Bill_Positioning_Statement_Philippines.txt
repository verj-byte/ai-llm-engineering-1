### Statement on the Positioning of AI Bills in the Philippines

The proposed AI Bill, specifically Senate Bill No. 25, introduced by Senator Pia S. Cayetano, aims to establish a comprehensive legal framework for the regulation and ethical deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in the Philippines. As AI technology continues to evolve and significantly impact various sectors—including public services, agriculture, education, and healthcare—the importance of a robust regulatory approach cannot be overstated. This bill reflects a balanced effort to harness AI's potential while addressing pertinent risks such as algorithmic bias and the implications of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).

The Philippines, in its pursuit of digital transformation, recognizes the dual-edged nature of AI. The potential benefits of improved efficiency, enhanced capabilities, and innovation must be juxtaposed against the dangers of misuse, bias, and security concerns. Thus, the bill underscores the urgency of integrating ethical considerations and human oversight in the development and deployment of AI technologies. By doing so, it aspires to foster a safe, inclusive, and responsible AI ecosystem that serves to protect the rights and welfare of citizens while promoting Filipino ingenuity.

Implementing such regulatory measures is both timely and feasible. The global landscape is witnessing significant movements toward AI governance, as seen with the European Union's AI Act, which emphasizes risk-based classification and accountability. By aligning with international best practices, the Philippines can establish itself as a proactive player in global AI discussions, ensuring that its policies reflect a commitment to ethical innovation.

In summary, Senate Bill No. 25 offers a pragmatic and forward-thinking approach to AI regulation in the Philippines. Its enactment would not only safeguard public interest but also empower the nation to fully realize the benefits of AI technology in a responsible and equitable manner.
