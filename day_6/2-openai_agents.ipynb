    "Structured response templates are important in agentic workflows because they ensure consistency, reliability, and machine-readability of the model’s outputs, which is critical when chaining multiple tools or agents together. Without a structured format, downstream components may misinterpret free-form text, leading to errors or unpredictable behavior. By enforcing a schema (e.g., JSON with predefined fields), developers can guarantee that outputs align with expected data types, reduce the need for brittle text parsing, and make the overall workflow more robust, interpretable, and easier to debug or extend."

Unlike standard completion models that may optimize for fluency or brevity, reasoning models explicitly track intermediate steps, which reduces errors, ensures consistency, and makes the report more reliable. This is especially valuable when comparing retrievers, weighing trade-offs like cost, latency, and performance, or when we need to present structured, evidence-based insights. In short, reasoning models help us move beyond surface-level summaries and toward clear, well-justified conclusions that hold up under scrutiny."
