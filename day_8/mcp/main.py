Main Entry Point for Day 8 MCP Project

This is the default entry point created by uv when initializing the project.
It serves as a simple demonstration of the project structure.

The actual functionality is provided by:
- mcp_server.py: MCP server implementation
- mcp_client.py: Stdio client for MCP communication
- mcp_http_client.py: HTTP client for web-based access
